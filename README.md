# Movies-ETL
Amazing Prime loves the dataset and wants to keep it updated on a daily basis. The pupose of the analysis is that Britta needs help to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. Module Code needs to be refactored by creating a function that takes three files:
- Wikipedia
- Kaggle Metadata
- MovieLens Rating Data 

All the three above files will perform Extract, Transfer and load process (ETL) by adding the data to a PostgreSQL Database. 

# Results:
### Deliverable 1: ETL Function to Read Three Data Files


### Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data


### Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle data


### Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database
